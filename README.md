#Project 4: PulseCheck Feedback App

Client: HarborTech HR Solutions

Client Brief:

“We’re piloting a lightweight internal feedback app for our HR department. Think of it as a quarterly pulse check for how employees are feeling. The responses need to be completely anonymous — we don’t want anyone worrying their feedback is tracked.
HR managers need a simple dashboard to see what’s coming in, filtered by categories like morale, workload, etc. And we’d like to be able to export results into a CSV for reports. We’ll run this on our internal network, so no need for public hosting. Keep it simple and secure.”

Must-Haves:
HR login; anonymous employee input.


Admin dashboard with export capability.


Feedback categories and cycle management.


Email notifications.
